# @package help
#
# This custom help command is a replacement for the default one on any Discord Bot written in discord.py!
# However, you must put "bot.remove_command('help')" in your bot, and the command must be in a cog for it to work.
#
# Original concept by [Jared Newsom (AKA Jared M.F.)](https://gist.github.com/StudioMFTechnologies/ad41bfd32b2379ccffe90b0e34128b8b)
# Rewritten and optimized by [nonchris](https://github.com/nonchris)
#
# This version relies more on the structure around this module than the gist does, which is more 'stand alone'
